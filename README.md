###About Sojourn

Sojourn is a simple travel recommendation app, which allows the users to not only explore new places in a given area of their choice, but also allows them to
seacrh for famous tourist spots all over India, and see what other tourists say about them. Tourism is one of India's biggest monetary means of development.Sojourn is an attempt to enhance the reach of tourism to all people.

You can try out the demo application at <a href="https://sojourn-fbmkb2ecngwii6afg7uwsc.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">here</a>
<br>

The main algorithm used for recommendation is **Content-Based Filtering**, which is aimed to find the similarity between the two entities. Here, the similarity score is calculated baseed
on 3 main indexdes - location, name of the spot and concatenated reviews posted by others tourists.

The base app, as of now, includes two main features:
> 1. **Find** - Allows the user to find a place of choice and see what is other people's opinion about them.
> 2. **Explore** - Allows the user to see famous spots in the city of their choice, and also similar places in other cities.
